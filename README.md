# Newsletter Sign-Up Component

## Why I Built This
This project was created to enhance my skills in building interactive forms with client-side validation. It was a great opportunity to dive deeper into Tailwind CSS and JavaScript, while also revise how to handle simple form validation, loading states, and success messages in an elegant way.

## Features
- An article preview section with interactive elements.
- Clean and responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.
- Simple JavaScript logic for handling any dynamic behavior in the component.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For the structure of the component.
- JavaScript: For interactivity and any dynamic functionality.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling and layout using utility classes.

## Live Demo
